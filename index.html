            <h1>Alexis Feeney</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Software Engineering Major</p>
            <p>I am currently a sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Science
                in Software Engineering with a minor in Cybersecurity.
                My passion for learning has guided me to the digital
                world as I see it as intertwined with everyday life.
                Exploring how to create and protect applications online
                has led me to the Software engineering field and I am
                looking forward to collaborating and learning from others
                with a shared passion.

                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists on
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navitation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <p>During the Spring 2023 semester I worked as an ungraduate research assitant. I researched and
                    evaluated the benefits and challenges of Software Defined Networks and its possible implementation
                    on Power Grids. Utilized Mininet, an open-source software, and deployed Python libraries to create
                    virtual
                    Software Defined Networks for testing purposes.Documented and organized research findings and
                    progress
                    updates, ensuring easy access for future reference and enabling efficient collaboration among team
                    members.</p>
